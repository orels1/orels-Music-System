## Installation {{ date: '2025-01-01T00:00Z', label: 'Get Started' }}

- Add to the VRChat Creator Companion using this link: [Add to the VCC](vcc://vpm/addRepo?url=https://orels1.github.io/orels-Music-System/index.json)
- Make sure the "orels-Music-System" Repository is added and selected in the Settings screen
- Open your World project and add the "ORL Music System" Package

## Setup

- Make a new GameObject and add the `MusicSystem` component to it
- Create two AudioSources, set them to 2D and set everything else the way you like
- Drag the AudioSources into the MusicSystem's `Source A` and `Source B` slots

Now let's add some music that will play all across your world!

- Create another GameObject anywhere in the scene and add the `GlobalPlaylist` component to it
- Set the Music System reference to your MusicSystem GameObject. If you only have one - a button will be shown to quickly assign it
- Add your Audio Clips to the `Playlist` array
- Configure the settings to your liking

> **Most settings have tooltips or other help messages!**

If you need localized music playback for specific areas of your world - you can utilize `LocalPlaylist` components

- Add the `LocalPlaylist` component to any GameObject
- Configure it similarly to the `GlobalPlaylist` component
- Add a Trigger Collider to the same game object, and you should be good to go!


If you ever need to stop the music when the player enters an area - you can use the `MuteZone` component

- Add `MuteZone` to any GameObject with a Trigger collider and it should work automatically

![v1.0.0 Release](@/images/image-3.png "v1.0.0 Release")

## v1.0.0 Release {{ date: '2023-10-27T00:00Z' }}

First release of orels Music System!
I always wanted to make something like this for my own worlds, but never got around to it.

Recently - my friend Fins asked for such a system for his new world - Complex 7 and I had to help! What you see here is the initial version of the system mostly tailored to his needs.

There are many new features I'd like to add in the future, but this should be a good first step

### <BoltIcon /> New Features

- GlobalPlaylist to play music everywhere in the World. Most useful for "main area" background music where making a giant collider is inconvenient
- LocalPlaylist to play music in a specific area of the World. Has an ability to define the minimum amount of time the player must be in the area for the music to transition.
- Support for multiple MusicSystems. E.g. one for actual music and one for ambient sounds
- MuteZone to stop any music playback when entering an area
- Some basic public api to Pause and Resume music playback
