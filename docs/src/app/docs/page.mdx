## Get Started

### Installation

- Add to the VRChat Creator Companion using this link: [Add to the VCC](vcc://vpm/addRepo?url=https://orels1.github.io/orels-Music-System/index.json)
- Make sure the "orels-Music-System" Repository is added and selected in the Settings screen
- Open your World project and add the "ORL Music System" Package

### Basic Setup

- Make a new GameObject and add the `MusicSystem` component to it
- Create two AudioSources, set them to 2D and set everything else the way you like
- Drag the AudioSources into the MusicSystem's `Source A` and `Source B` slots

Now let's add some music that will play all across your world!

- Create another GameObject anywhere in the scene and add the `GlobalPlaylist` component to it
- Set the Music System reference to your MusicSystem GameObject. If you only have one - a button will be shown to quickly assign it
- Add your Audio Clips to the `Playlist` array
- Configure the settings to your liking

![Example of a Global Playlist](@/images/image-1.png "Example of a Global Playlist")

> **Most settings have tooltips or other help messages!**

If you need localized music playback for specific areas of your world - you can utilize `LocalPlaylist` components

- Add the `LocalPlaylist` component to any GameObject
- Configure it similarly to the `GlobalPlaylist` component
- Add a Trigger Collider to the same game object, and you should be good to go!


If you ever need to stop the music when the player enters an area - you can use the `MuteZone` component

- Add `MuteZone` to any GameObject with a Trigger collider and it should work automatically

## Components

### Music System

![Music System Component](@/images/image-4.png "Music System Component")

> Music System component is the heart of the whole system. It is the only component that runs an Update loop, coordinates the various playlists and manages the Audio Sources

#### Configuration

The only options available are the two Audio Sources that will be used for playback

- **Source A**
- **Source B**

#### Runtime

When entering Play mode - the Music System component will show some information about its state

![Music System during Play mode](@/images/image-5.png "Music System during Play mode")

### Playlist Options

Every "Playlist" component (e.g. Global Playlist and Local Playlist) share the following set of options

![Playlist Options as visible on a Global Playlist](@/images/image-6.png "Playlist Options as visible on a Global Playlist")

- **Music System**: Reference to a Music System that will be used for playback. You can have multiple Music Systems in your scene to have simultaneous playback of multiple clips
- **Playlist**: Contains all the tracks that will be played
- **Shuffle Playlist**: Shuffles the playlist on load and every time the end is reached
- **Volume**: Sets the final volume of the AudioSource when playing this playlist
- Playlist Switching: This section controls how the playlist behaves when switching from and to it
  - **Switch In**: Sets the type of transition when switching to this playlist
    - Cut: switches immediately
    - Fade: fades the music in gradually when switching to the playlist
    - **Fade Time**: Controls how long the fade in lasts. Only visible when **Switch In** is set to **Fade**
  - **Switch Out**: Same as **Switch In** but for when switching out of this playlist to something else
- Transitions: This section controls how playlist switches between tracks
  - **Transition Type**: Sets how the tracks are blended together
    - Cut: switches immediately
    - Fade: fades the music out and in when switching between tracks
    - Cross Fade: fades in and out simultaneously, allowing for a smooth transition
  - **Fade Time**: Controls how long the fade out and fade in lasts. Only visible when **Transition Type** us set to **Fade**
  - **Cross Fade Curve**: Controls the cross-fade blend. Only visible when **Transition Type** us set to **Cross Fade**.
    - When the Curve is at Time 0 (far left) and at Value 0 (bottom) - the Track B (current track) is at 100% and Track A (next track) is at 0%
    - When the Curve is at Time 1 (far right) and at Value 1 (top) - the Track B (current track) is at 0% and Track A (next track) is at 100%
    - This allows you to create custom cross-fade curves and blend the tracks in any way you like
  - **Cross Fade Time**: Controls how long the cross-fade lasts. Only visible when **Transition Type** us set to **Cross Fade**
- Music Breaks: This section controls any pauses between individual tracks
  - **Randomize Pause**: Enables randomisation of the pause time between tracks
    - **Pause Min**: Minimum possible pause time
    - **Pause Max**: Maximum possible pause time
  - **Static Pause**: If set to anything above 0 - adds a pause between trecks for the specified time in seconds
- Long Break: This section controls a long pause between tracks after X amount of tracks were played
  - **Long Break**: Enables the long break
  - **Track Count**: Defines how many tracks will be played before doing a long break
  - **Reset on Switch**: If enabled - the track count will reset when switching to another playlist. In practical terms, this means that the player will need to listen to X tracks in a row before the long break will trigger
  - **Break Time**: Duration of the long break in seconds

### Global Playlist

> Global Playlist component is used to play music across the whole world. It is the simplest way to get started with the Music System

#### Configuration

Beyond the options listed in the [Playlist Options](#playlist-options) section, Global Playlist provides the following settings

- **Auto Play**: Starts the playlist automatically when entering Play mode / loading the world

### Local Playlist

> Local Playlist component is used to play music in a particular area defined by a collider. It is useful for creating localized music playback

#### Usage

- Add the Local Playlist component to any GameObject
- Add a Trigger collider of some sort to the same GameObject
- Set the Layer of the GameObject to "MirrorReflection"

#### Configuration

Beyond the options listed in the [Playlist Options](#playlist-options) section, Global Playlist provides the following settings

- Zone Settings
  - **Player Stay Delay**: Controls how long the player must be present in the zone before the playlist starts playing

### Mute Zone

![Mute Zone Component](@/images/image-7.png "Mute Zone Component")

> Mute Zone allows you to easily mute all music when entering an area

#### Usage

- Add a Mute Zone component to any GameObject
- Add a Trigger collider of some sort to the same GameObject
- Set the Music System to the Music System you would like to mute
  - If you want to mute more than 1 Music System - you can add multiple Mute Zone components to the same GameObject

#### Configuration

- **Music System**: Reference to a Music System that will be muted when entering the zone
- Zone Settings
  - **Player Stay Delay**: Controls how long the player must be present in the zone before the music is muted
- **Hard Pause**: If enabled - the music will be cut immediately as soon as **Player Stay Delay** passes. Otherwise - the music will follow the playlist switching rules and fade out if necessary
